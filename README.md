My name is Zhanatbek, and I am an aspiring iOS developer. I am interested in learning the Swift programming language and strive to become an experienced iOS developer. Previously, I was engaged in web programming and gained some experience in this field, I studied a lot on my own.

Now I am actively studying Swift, studying online resources and working on my own projects. I want to join the iOS developer community on GitHub to share knowledge, learn from experienced professionals, and share my projects.

I will be grateful for the opportunity to join your community and hope for a useful interaction.
